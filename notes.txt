DISCOVERY SERVER:
- 8761 is the default port for eureka discovery server, which the clients hit time to time, to register themselves.

MICRO-SERVICES FAULT TOLERANCE AND RESILIENCE:

	Fault Tolerance:
		given an application, if there is a fault, then what is the impact of the fault ?
	Resilience:
		is how many faults a system can tolerate
	
	Challenge 1: any instance of service going down
	Solution: we can have multiple instance running of single micro-service. The Eureka server registers all and does load balancing itself.
	
	Challenge 2: micro-service is slow (one slow micro-service should not affect the calls to other services). This happens generally because of multiple cocurrent threads running and none getting completed timely, hence overloading the system.
	Solution: Implement time-outs
